# Cypress pet project on [AutomationPractice](https://automationpractice.pl/)

## Getting started
- Install nodejs.
- Run the command npm install. It's installing the depedencies.
- npx cypress open.

## Why is this repository exist?
There are two primary reasons for my interest. First, I have worked with Selenium and .NET for several years, and Iâ€™ve observed that Cypress and Playwright are increasingly replacing Selenium for UI testing, particularly on modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular and React. To stay aligned with these advancements, I am eager to expand my skills in these tools, along with TypeScript, to better support current and future projects.

Second, gaining expertise in these technologies provides a strong advantage in job interviews, allowing me to effectively demonstrate my relevant, up-to-date knowledge.

## Can I contribute?
No, if it's not a must, I like to keep this repository to myself. If you like to help me, please raise a ticket on the issues tab.
